\subsection{ Use Case Diagram}
The Use Case (UC) diagram is a UML diagram that represents one of the initial design steps by providing a simple and clear presentation of the different functionalities provided by a system from the perspective of an external user. This diagram is primarily based on three main elements:
Actor: Whether it is a person or a system, it is typically represented by a stick figure.
System: The system to which the use case relates. It is represented by a rectangle.
Use Case: It is represented by an ellipse, usually containing a short phrase describing the process.

\subsection{Conceptual Data Model MCD}
The Conceptual Data Model (CDM) aims to formally describe the data that will be used by the information system. It is a representation of the data that is easily understandable and allows for describing the information system in a clear and concise manner.

\subsection{Conceptual Processing Model MCT}
The Conceptual Processing Model (MCT) allows for a schematic representation of the activity of an information system without referring to organizational choices or execution means. Its purpose is to provide a clear understanding of the processing activities required by the system, focusing on the logical flow of operations rather than implementation details. The following model describes the main action of our platform:\\
