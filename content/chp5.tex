\section{Technical Limitations and Constraints}

\subsection{Data Model Instability and Integration Challenges}

\subsubsection{Input Schema Evolution Challenges}

One of the most significant challenges encountered during the implementation was the continuous evolution of the input data model provided by the client organization. The lack of a finalized data schema created substantial technical debt and implementation complexity.

\textbf{Impact Analysis:}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Challenge} & \textbf{Technical Impact} & \textbf{Mitigation Strategy} \\ 
\hline
Schema Changes & 15+ data model revisions & Flexible Avro schema design \\
Field Additions & Backward compatibility issues & Schema registry versioning \\
Data Type Changes & Consumer reprocessing required & Event replay capabilities \\
Missing Critical Fields & Fee calculation logic gaps & Default value strategies \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data Model Evolution Impact and Mitigation}
\end{table}

\textbf{Engineering Assessment:}
The frequent schema modifications indicate a lack of domain analysis maturity in the client's preliminary design phase. From an engineering perspective, a more structured approach would involve:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain-Driven Design Workshop:} Comprehensive business analysis before technical implementation
    \item \textbf{Schema Governance:} Formal change management process for data structure modifications
    \item \textbf{API Contract Testing:} Consumer-driven contract testing to prevent breaking changes
    \item \textbf{Version Management:} Semantic versioning strategy for data schema evolution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fee Calculation Data Completeness}

The absence of finalized field specifications for fee calculation created implementation uncertainty and required defensive programming approaches.

\textbf{Missing Critical Data Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Merchant Risk Categories:} Essential for scheme fee cost code determination
    \item \textbf{Card Product Details:} Required for accurate interchange classification
    \item \textbf{Transaction Channel Metadata:} Needed for card-present/card-not-present determination
    \item \textbf{Authorization Network Data:} Critical for bilateral agreement lookups
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Defensive Implementation Strategy:}
To address these uncertainties, the implementation adopted a flexible architecture with configurable business rule engines, allowing for future field integration without requiring core engine modifications.

\subsection{Infrastructure and Resource Constraints}

\subsubsection{Development Environment Limitations}

The proof-of-concept development was constrained by single-host infrastructure limitations that prevented optimal performance validation.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Constraint} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Production Difference} \\
\hline
Single Host Deployment & Resource contention & Dedicated microservice hosts \\
Shared Database Instance & I/O bottlenecks & Clustered database architecture \\
Development Hardware & Limited CPU/Memory & Enterprise-grade infrastructure \\
Network Topology & Local latency only & Multi-zone network optimization \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Development vs. Production Infrastructure Comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Performance Impact Analysis:}
The achieved 1038.12 TPS represents performance under suboptimal conditions. Production deployment with dedicated infrastructure is projected to achieve 2500+ TPS based on resource utilization analysis.

\subsubsection{Technology Stack Maturity Constraints}

While the chosen technology stack provided robust foundations, certain limitations became apparent during implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kafka Consumer Lag:} Development cluster configuration limited optimal consumer group scaling
    \item \textbf{PostgreSQL Connection Pooling:} Single-instance deployment constrained concurrent transaction processing
    \item \textbf{Redis Clustering:} Development environment lacked distributed caching optimization
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Infrastructure:} Limited observability tools for comprehensive performance analysis
\end{itemize}

\section{Organizational and Process Limitations}

\subsection{Requirements Engineering Challenges}

\subsubsection{Agile Process Maturity Assessment}

The client organization's approach to requirements management demonstrated areas for improvement from a software engineering perspective.

\textbf{Process Analysis:}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Process Area} & \textbf{Current State} & \textbf{Engineering Recommendation} \\
\hline
Requirements Definition & Iterative changes & Formal specification phase \\
Stakeholder Alignment & Multiple conflicting inputs & Single product owner model \\
Change Management & Informal process & Structured change control board \\
Testing Criteria & Undefined acceptance & Formal acceptance criteria \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Requirements Engineering Process Assessment}
\end{table}

\textbf{Impact on Development Velocity:}
The absence of stable requirements resulted in approximately 30\% additional development effort due to rework and architectural adjustments. This represents a significant opportunity cost that could have been mitigated through improved requirements engineering practices.

\subsubsection{Domain Expertise Integration}

The project revealed gaps in domain knowledge transfer between business stakeholders and technical implementation teams.

\textbf{Knowledge Transfer Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Payment Industry Complexity:} Insufficient business rule documentation
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Requirements:} Incomplete compliance specification
    \item \textbf{Fee Calculation Logic:} Inconsistent business rule interpretation
    \item \textbf{Integration Dependencies:} Unclear external system interfaces
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Engineering Perspective:}
A more structured approach would benefit from domain-driven design workshops and comprehensive business analysis before technical architecture decisions.

\subsection{Technology Decision Making Process}

\subsubsection{Architecture Review Methodology}

The client organization's technology evaluation process could benefit from more rigorous architectural review practices.

\textbf{Observed Process Gaps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance Requirements:} Insufficient non-functional requirement specification
    \item \textbf{Scalability Planning:} Limited capacity planning analysis
    \item \textbf{Technology Evaluation:} Informal proof-of-concept validation criteria
    \item \textbf{Risk Assessment:} Inadequate technical risk identification and mitigation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommended Improvements:}
From an engineering best practices perspective, the following enhancements would strengthen the technology decision-making process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):} Formal documentation of technology choices and rationale
    \item \textbf{Performance Acceptance Criteria:} Quantified performance requirements with clear success metrics
    \item \textbf{Technical Risk Register:} Systematic identification and mitigation of technical risks

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Technology Decision Validation Under Constraints}
\end{table}

\subsection{Implementation Strategy Defense}

\subsubsection{Proof-of-Concept Scope Management}

The decision to maintain focused proof-of-concept scope despite client requests for extended functionality demonstrated sound engineering judgment.

\textbf{Scope Boundary Management:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Functionality Focus:} Fee calculation engine validation prioritized over peripheral features
    \item \textbf{Performance Baseline:} Throughput validation achieved despite infrastructure limitations
    \item \textbf{Architecture Validation:} Stateless processing concepts successfully demonstrated
