\section{Analysis of the Existing System}

The current P2S compute engine is primarily a monolithic system that processes transactions collectively. It was originally designed to operate with a minimal set of input parameters, which resulted in only medium to low accuracy in fee calculations. Additionally, the system lacks the capability to distribute processing across multiple compute engines, limiting its flexibility and scalability.

To overcome these limitations, the new system is built on a stateless, event-driven architecture that supports enhanced scalability, flexibility, and accuracy where each step is stateless and we can scale on choice the stages of processing that are causing bottlenecks.
 By incorporating multiple specialized compute engines—each handling a specific component of the fee calculation—we aim to create a more modular and efficient framework.

Furthermore, in collaboration with the client, we’ve designed a comprehensive transaction data model that is ISO 20022 compliant and established a shared messaging stream.
 This stream carries a rich set of input parameters (+ 100), enabling the system to consider a wide range of factors in fee calculations and significantly improve result accuracy.

\section{Theoretical Foundation: Event-Driven Architecture}

\subsection{Event-Driven Architecture Principles}

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) represents a software design paradigm that promotes the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events \cite{hohpe2003enterprise}. In the context of financial transaction processing, EDA provides several fundamental advantages that address the limitations identified in traditional monolithic architectures.

\subsubsection{Core EDA Concepts}

\textbf{Event Definition and Characteristics:}
An event represents a significant change in state or an occurrence that has business relevance. In payment processing systems, events include transaction initiation, context qualification completion, fee calculation results, and error conditions. Events possess several critical characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immutability:} Events represent historical facts that cannot be changed
    \item \textbf{Atomicity:} Each event represents a complete, indivisible occurrence
    \item \textbf{Temporal Ordering:} Events carry temporal information enabling proper sequencing
    \item \textbf{Business Relevance:} Each event corresponds to meaningful business activities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Producer-Consumer Decoupling:}
EDA enables loose coupling between system components through asynchronous message exchange. Event producers generate events without knowledge of consumers, while event consumers process events without direct dependency on producers.

\subsection{EDA Benefits for Financial Processing}

\subsubsection{Scalability and Performance Benefits}

\textbf{Horizontal Scalability:}
EDA enables independent scaling of different processing components based on actual load patterns. Context qualification engines can scale independently from fee calculation engines, optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.

\textbf{Asynchronous Processing:}
Non-blocking event processing eliminates wait times and enables higher throughput. Components can process events as resources become available, preventing bottlenecks from cascading through the system.

\subsubsection{Resilience and Fault Tolerance Benefits}

\textbf{Fault Isolation:}
Component failures in EDA systems remain isolated and do not propagate to other components. If the interchange calculation engine fails, context qualification and scheme fee calculation continue operating normally.

\textbf{Automatic Recovery:}
Event persistence in message brokers enables automatic recovery from component failures. When components restart, they can resume processing from their last known position without data loss.

\subsection{Technology Selection Analysis}

\subsubsection{Apache Kafka Selection Rationale}

Apache Kafka was selected as the message broker for the P2S compute engines based on comprehensive technology analysis:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Throughput} & \textbf{Durability} & \textbf{Scalability} & \textbf{Financial Suitability} \\
\hline
Apache Kafka & High & High & High & Excellent \\
RabbitMQ & Medium & Medium & Medium & Good \\
Amazon SQS & Medium & High & High & Good \\
Apache Pulsar & High & High & High & Good \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Message Broker Technology Comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Kafka Advantages for Fee Calculation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exactly-Once Semantics:} Critical for financial accuracy requirements
    \item \textbf{High Throughput:} Supports millions of transactions per second
    \item \textbf{Event Replay:} Enables transaction replay for testing and audit
    \item \textbf{Stream Processing:} Native support for real-time analytics
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution Architecture Design}

\subsection{Microservices Architecture Selection}

The adoption of microservices architecture for the P2S compute engines addresses the fundamental limitations of the existing monolithic system while providing specific advantages for financial transaction processing.

\subsubsection{Domain-Driven Design Alignment}

Each microservice aligns with specific business domains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meta Worker:} Transaction routing and enrichment domain
    \item \textbf{Context Engine:} Transaction qualification and categorization domain
    \item \textbf{Interchange Engine:} Bilateral fee calculation domain
    \item \textbf{Scheme Fee Engine:} Network-specific fee calculation domain
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stateless Processing Design}

All P2S compute engines implement stateless processing patterns where each request contains complete information necessary for processing. This design provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Scalability:} New instances can be added without state synchronization
    \item \textbf{Fault Recovery:} Component restart does not require state restoration
    \item \textbf{Load Distribution:} Requests can be processed by any available instance
    \item \textbf{Simplified Testing:} Each request can be tested independently
\end{itemize}
