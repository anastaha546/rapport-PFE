% This project has successfully created a semantic archive system designed to help organizations transition from paper-based document management to a fully digital, searchable system. By leveraging OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction and NER (Named Entity Recognition) for semantic enrichment, the system makes it possible to convert physical records into valuable, structured digital formats. The use of Elasticsearch ensures fast, efficient, and accurate searches across a wide variety of documents in English, French, and Arabic.

% Looking ahead, there are several perspectives for future improvements and potential enhancements:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Integration of More Advanced OCR Models:} Future versions of the system could integrate more sophisticated OCR models that offer improved accuracy for various document types, especially those with challenging layouts or handwriting.
%     \item \textbf{User Interface Enhancements:} Improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly will be key to increasing system adoption. Adding features such as document preview, batch processing, and user-specific filtering could further improve usability.
%     \item \textbf{Improved Semantic Search:} Expanding the semantic search capabilities to include advanced NLP techniques like contextual search, fuzzy matching, or the ability to rank results based on relevance could make the system even more powerful.
%     \item \textbf{Compliance and Security Features:} As document management involves sensitive information, future iterations could focus on ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, and adding robust security measures, including encryption and access control.
%     \item \textbf{AI-Powered Document Classification:} Introducing AI algorithms to automatically classify documents into predefined categories based on their content would streamline the organization and retrieval process.
%     \item \textbf{Cloud Integration:} Moving the system to the cloud would enable scalability, real-time document processing, and collaboration features for larger organizations.
% \end{itemize}

% In conclusion, the project has laid the groundwork for a sophisticated and efficient system to digitize and manage paper-based documents. With future improvements, the system could offer even greater functionality, supporting organizations in the transition to fully digital document management.
